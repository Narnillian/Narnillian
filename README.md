Hello, my name is Narnillian! I'm a 10th grader in Los Angeles, and I taught myself how to code. I started with Python, learned Kotlin, but then changed my mind and now I'm using C a lot. Sometime soon I'll learn HTML/CSS/JS and make a thing or two.

I'm interested in everything. Teach me anything, and don't hesitate to reach out! I'm available on [DEV.to](https://dev.to/narnillian "DEV.to - Blogging site for developers") and [GitHub](github.com/narnillian "GitHub - You're already here!").
