- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Narnillian
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in everything. Always have been.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python, C++, I may learn Kotlin, and am thinking of a project that would require learning API calls.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me:
  - [DEV.to](https://dev.to/narnillian "DEV.to - Blogging site for developers")
  - [GitHub](github.com/narnillian "GitHub - You're already here!")

I'm currently a freshman in High School in LA. I have a very specific programming style and I'm aware of it. Although it may seem strange, I'll look at pull requests to this repo. I try to be open to what people have to say.
